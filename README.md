# IoT Using Raspberry Pi and Firebase and Android

In a nutshell, I will create a smart device that can get temperature and humidity wirelessly using DHT11 with Raspberry Pi 4 over Wi-Fi on your Android smartphone. This project is divided into three main parts.

-	Android mobile application.
The mobile app which read temperature and humidity sensor data on real time.
-	Database.
Firebase database will receive some data from the mobile app or Raspberry Pi.
-	Electronic and control circuit.
The control circuit will be based on the raspberry pi board which running a python script reading the incoming data from the firebase database and according to these data will take some different actions.

#### Purpose
To create an android app and send data to Firebase RealTime Database.

#### Language
Implementation in Python with Raspberry Pi 4
